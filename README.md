## Description

A simple book recommendation agent.
Utilises ollama/llama3 and web search via DuckDuckGo.
Usage is pretty self explanatory.

### Task Type

Agentic RAG with LangGraph

### Results Summary

- Web search assists with getting recent books/trends/opinions in contrast to only training data when just prompting LLM.
- Some of the "intelligence" is lost, as it is backed by a simple "books like..." web search.
- Is very basic and can be refined in a lot of aspects.
